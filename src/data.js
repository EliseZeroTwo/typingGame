  "Though my story's seldom told, I have squandered my resistance. For a pocketful of mumbles such are promises, all lies and jest. Still, a man hears what he wants to hear and disregards the rest.",
  "I suddenly had the impression that I had been left all alone, that everyone was shrinking away from me, avoiding me. You are, of course, right to ask who that everyone is, for although I've lived in Petersburg for eight years now, I haven't managed to make a single friend."
